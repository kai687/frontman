description: The origin of the project.

<!-- vale Google.We = NO -->

Frontman is an evolution of another Ruby-based static site generator,
[Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/).
It is a fantastic tool with many features and a large community.
At Algolia, we used Middleman to build the documentation.

However, once the docs reached a certain size,
Middleman became too slow.
Instead of migrating to a completely new platform,
we decided to innovate and iterate the existing code base.

That's how Frontman was born.

We created Frontman with a strong focus on speed, but also as a quick and easy replacement for Middleman.
Our goal was to be able to switch from the Middleman gem to the Frontman gem in your project, and for the migration to take less than a day.

To dive deeper into why and how we made Frontman fast,
