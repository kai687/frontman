If you have a lot of data and you want to render pages for each item of it,
without having to copy and paste the same content, you can use Frontman's `add_proxy` function:

```rb
# config.rb
sitemap_tree.add_proxy('<DESTINATION>', '<LAYOUT>', { <DATA> })
```

The `sitemap_tree` is the central data structure of Frontman and knows about all pages.

The `add_proxy` function takes three parameters:

`<DESTINATION>` (required)
: The URL where the page should be available.
  You must include `/index.html` at the end.

`<LAYOUT>` (required)
: The layout for rendering the page.

`<DATA>`
: A hash with custom data you want to make available inside the layout.

For example:

```rb
# config.rb
['Idris', 'Naomi'].each do |employee|
  sitemap_tree.add_proxy("/about/#{employee.downcase}/index.html", 'views/layouts/about.haml', { employee_name: employee })
end
```

In your layout file `about.haml`, you can render the employee's name:

```haml
-# views/layouts/about.haml
%h1
 = "About #{employee_name}"
```
