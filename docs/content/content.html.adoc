Frontman looks for your content files in the `:content_dir`
directory, which is `source` by default.
This means, Frontman converts all files with recognized file extensions to HTML.
To change the content directory, see <<configuration#content, Configuration>>.

For a more customized setup, you can add content in your `config.rb` file:

[,ruby]
----
# config.rb

# Turn off default content directory
content_dir = Frontman::Config.get(nil)

# Add all recognized files from a directory
Frontman::Bootstrapper.resources_from_dir('custom/path').each do |resource|
  sitemap_tree.add(resource)
end
