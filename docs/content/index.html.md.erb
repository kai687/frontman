## Get started

Frontman requires Ruby version <%= data.site.min_ruby_version %> or later.

To get started, add the `frontman-ssg` gem to your `Gemfile`:

```sh
bundle add frontman-ssg --version '~> <%= data.site.frontman_version %>'
```

> You can create a new `Gemfile` by running: `bundle init`.

## Create a new project

The `frontman init` command scaffolds a basic project for you to get started.
To create a new project in the directory `<NEW_PROJECT>`, run:

```sh
frontman init <NEW_PROJECT>
```

> If you started  a new project with `bundle init`, you can create the new site in the current directory.
> Run `frontman init .`

## Start developing your site

The `frontman serve` command starts a development server for you to preview your changes.
To start it, run:

```sh
cd <NEW_PROJECT>
bundle install
bundle exec frontman serve
```

By default, the preview is available at [http://localhost:4568](http://localhost:4568).
If you edit the page `source/index.html.md.erb`,
the preview automatically refreshes in your browser.

## Add more content

Add more pages to the `source` directory and they get automatically converted to HTML.
For example, create a new file `source/about.html.md.erb` and enter the following content.

```markdown
---
title: About
---

Write some content with **Markdown**.
```

This new page will be available at [http://localhost:4568/about](http://localhost:4568/about).

## Build your site

To build your static website, run:

```sh
bundle exec frontman build
```

Your website will be in the `build` directory.
